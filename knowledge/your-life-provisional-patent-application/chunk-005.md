The invention further provides a **multi‑layer sharing model** that allows content to exist in four distinct scopes:  
1. **Private** (visible only to the creator)  
2. **Collaborative** (shared with selected individuals)  
3. **Community** (shared with the platform’s broader creative network)  
4. **Public** (exposed to the external world through a public‑facing AI agent)

Each layer is governed by a unified permissioning and routing system that ensures content is retrieved, processed, and exposed only within its intended scope. The system enables creators to selectively share items across projects, collaborate with trusted partners, publish to a supportive community, and maintain a public presence—all from the same underlying knowledge base.
