These claims define the scope of protection sought for the invention. They are intentionally broad, covering the system, its components, its flows, and its unique combinations. Because this is a provisional filing, these claims do not need to be formalized or numbered according to USPTO standards; however, they are written in a format that can be easily converted into formal claims later.
