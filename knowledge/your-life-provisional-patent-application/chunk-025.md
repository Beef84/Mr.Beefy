### 5. A public AI representative that acts as a creator’s digital persona  
The invention introduces a **public‑facing AI representative** that:

- communicates in the creator’s voice  
- presents their work  
- answers questions  
- directs supporters to relevant destinations  
- operates exclusively on public‑scoped data  

This is fundamentally different from chatbots, customer service agents, or personal assistants.  
It is a **creator‑centric digital persona** with controlled access to a structured memory system.

## Non‑Obviousness of the Invention

### 1. The combination of private memory, collaboration, community, and public representation is not obvious  
Existing systems treat these domains separately:

- AI assistants handle private tasks  
- collaboration tools handle shared work  
- social platforms handle community publishing  
- websites handle public presence  

The invention unifies all four into a single architecture with:

- shared data models  
- shared ingestion pipelines  
- shared agents  
- shared style profiles  
- shared knowledge bases  

This integration is non‑obvious because these domains traditionally operate in isolation.
