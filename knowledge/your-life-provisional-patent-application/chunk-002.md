A second source of inspiration came from the comedy show **Kill Tony**, where Tony Hinchcliffe provides a platform for new comedians to step into the spotlight. The show’s structure — private preparation, collaborative refinement, community exposure, and public performance — mirrors the four visibility layers of the invention. This parallel helped shape the system’s model of private creativity, selective collaboration, community publishing, and public representation.

Together, these influences led to the creation of **Your Life**, a platform where a creator’s personal world becomes a structured, intelligent environment powered by AI memory, multi‑agent orchestration, and controlled visibility.
