A key component of the invention is the **public AI representative**, a configurable agent that communicates in the creator’s voice, presents their work, and interacts with external audiences. This representative can be embedded on websites, connected to external platforms, and configured to perform actions such as answering questions, showcasing projects, scheduling meetings, or directing supporters to relevant destinations. The public agent operates exclusively on content explicitly marked as public, ensuring privacy and safety while enabling creators to build a public identity powered by their own AI.

The system is implemented as a **multi‑tenant cloud architecture**, where each creator is treated as an isolated tenant with dedicated data boundaries, project structures, and agent configurations. The architecture supports scalable ingestion pipelines, vectorized memory retrieval, style modeling, selective sharing, and multi‑agent orchestration. The invention includes mechanisms for tenant provisioning, resource isolation, cross‑project item referencing, and public agent configuration.
