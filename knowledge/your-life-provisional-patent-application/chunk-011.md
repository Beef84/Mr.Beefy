## 6. Multi‑Layer Sharing Model

The system introduces a four‑layer sharing model:

### 6.1 Private Layer  
Content is visible only to the tenant and their private agent.

### 6.2 Collaborative Layer  
Content may be shared with specific collaborators. Access is controlled through:

- item‑level permissions  
- project‑level membership  
- role‑based access (owner, editor, viewer)  

Collaborators may comment, contribute, or co‑create depending on permissions.

### 6.3 Community Layer  
Content may be published to the platform’s broader creative community. Community content is:

- indexed separately  
- visible to all tenants  
- available for feedback, discovery, and inspiration  

### 6.4 Public Layer  
Content may be exposed to the external world through the public agent. Public content is:

- explicitly marked as public  
- accessible through public endpoints  
- used by the public agent to represent the creator  

This multi‑layer model enables granular control over visibility and collaboration.
