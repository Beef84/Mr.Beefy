**Your Life** is a multi‑layered artificial intelligence platform that enables an individual creator (“tenant”) to construct, manage, and publicly express a personalized digital world powered by persistent AI agents, a structured personal knowledge base, selective collaboration mechanisms, community publishing, and a public‑facing AI representative. The system transforms a user’s ideas, artifacts, and creative identity into an actionable, intelligent environment that supports private creation, collaborative work, community engagement, and public representation.

The invention introduces a unified architecture in which all user‑generated content—text, audio, video, images, and interactions—is automatically ingested, transcribed, analyzed, summarized, and embedded into a **tenant‑scoped personal knowledge base**. This knowledge base is used by a **private AI agent** that learns the user’s style, preferences, and creative patterns, enabling it to perform tasks, generate content, retrieve memories, and assist with project development. The system allows users to offload unwanted tasks to the agent, enabling them to focus on the aspects of their life and creative work they value most.
