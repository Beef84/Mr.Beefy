### 2. Visibility‑aware AI retrieval is not present in prior art  
Conventional AI systems retrieve information from a single context or knowledge base.  
The invention introduces:

- multi‑scope retrieval  
- scope‑restricted tools  
- visibility‑filtered embeddings  
- agent‑level enforcement of permissions  

This requires architectural decisions that are not obvious from existing AI retrieval systems.

### 3. The dual‑agent model solves a problem no one else has addressed  
Creators need:

- a private assistant that knows everything  
- a public representative that knows only what is safe  

The invention solves this through:

- shared memory  
- segmented visibility  
- tool‑level restrictions  
- style‑consistent generation  

This is not an obvious extension of existing AI assistants, which typically operate with a single context and no visibility segmentation.

### 4. Cross‑project item referencing with tenant‑scoped memory is non‑obvious  
The system allows items to:

- belong to one project  
- be referenced by many  
- remain part of a unified memory system  

This enables:

- multi‑context retrieval  
- cross‑domain creativity  
- persistent identity modeling
