No existing AI assistant or platform integrates visibility constraints directly into the agent’s retrieval and reasoning mechanisms.

### 3. A unified ingestion pipeline that transforms all media into structured memory  
The system automatically converts text, audio, video, and images into:

- transcripts  
- summaries  
- semantic tags  
- vector embeddings  
- style profiles  
- project associations  

This creates a **persistent, evolving memory system** unique to each creator.  
Existing tools may transcribe or summarize, but none unify all media types into a single, tenant‑scoped knowledge base that powers multiple agents and multiple visibility layers.

### 4. A personal world model where projects, items, and agents form a cohesive digital identity  
The invention treats each creator as a **tenant‑scoped universe**, where:

- projects represent creative domains  
- items represent memories, artifacts, and ideas  
- agents represent the creator privately and publicly  
- the knowledge base represents the creator’s evolving identity  

This world model is not present in any existing AI assistant, productivity tool, or social platform.
