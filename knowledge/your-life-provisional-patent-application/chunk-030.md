## **Embodiment 3: Decentralized Knowledge Base with Federated Agents**

In this embodiment, the personal knowledge base is distributed across multiple storage nodes or devices, and agents operate in a federated manner.

### Components
- Distributed vector stores  
- Federated LLM inference nodes  
- Local and remote agent instances  
- Consensus‑based visibility enforcement  

### Operation
- Each node stores a subset of the tenant’s memory.  
- Agents query multiple nodes and aggregate results.  
- Visibility layers are enforced through cryptographic signatures and access tokens.

This embodiment supports privacy‑first or decentralized deployments.

## **Embodiment 4: Single‑Tenant Enterprise Deployment**

In this embodiment, the system is deployed for a single enterprise or organization, where each employee or creator is treated as a sub‑tenant.

### Components
- Dedicated cloud account  
- Enterprise identity provider integration  
- Internal collaboration and community layers  
- Enterprise‑scoped public agents  

### Operation
- Employees share items across teams and departments.  
- Enterprise administrators manage visibility and permissions.
