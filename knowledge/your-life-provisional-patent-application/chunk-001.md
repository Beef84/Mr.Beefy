# **Background of the Invention**

The invention emerged from the creator’s work designing and building **Mr. Beefy**, an AI‑powered personal agent intended to reflect the creator’s voice, style, and technical identity. Through the process of constructing a self‑documenting AI resume, it became clear that the underlying architecture could support something far broader: a persistent, multi‑layered digital world where a creator’s ideas, artifacts, and identity could be organized, remembered, and expressed through intelligent agents.
