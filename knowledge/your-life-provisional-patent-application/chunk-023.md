## Novelty of the Invention

### 1. A dual‑agent architecture tied to a single personal knowledge base  
The invention introduces a system where each creator is represented by **two distinct AI agents**—a private agent and a public agent—both powered by a **shared but visibility‑segmented personal knowledge base**.  
No existing platform provides:

- a private agent with full memory access  
- a public agent with restricted, public‑only access  
- both operating on the same underlying structured memory  
- both maintaining stylistic consistency with the creator  

This dual‑agent model is unique in its structure, purpose, and technical implementation.

### 2. A four‑layer visibility model integrated into AI retrieval and generation  
The invention defines a **multi‑layer sharing system** (private → collaborative → community → public) that is enforced at the retrieval and generation layers of the AI system.  
This is novel because:

- AI retrieval is visibility‑aware  
- agent tools are scope‑restricted  
- content transitions require explicit user action  
- the public agent is technically prevented from accessing private memory
