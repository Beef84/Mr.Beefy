## **Embodiment 5: Multi‑Agent Ecosystem with Specialized Agents**

In this embodiment, each tenant has multiple specialized agents, such as:

- **Creative Agent** — writing, ideation, content generation  
- **Organizational Agent** — task management, planning  
- **Analytical Agent** — summarization, research, insight extraction  
- **Public Agent** — external representation  

### Operation
- Agents share a common knowledge base but operate with different toolsets.  
- Agents may collaborate with each other to complete complex tasks.  
- The tenant may assign tasks to specific agents.

This embodiment extends the dual‑agent model into a full agent ecosystem.
