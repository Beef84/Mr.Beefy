A system and method for enabling an individual creator to construct and manage a personalized digital world through a multi‑layered artificial intelligence platform. The system ingests text, audio, video, and images into a tenant‑scoped personal knowledge base containing vector embeddings, metadata, and stylistic profiles. A private AI agent accesses the full knowledge base to assist with creation, organization, and project development, while a public AI agent operates on a restricted public subset to represent the creator externally. A four‑layer visibility model governs private, collaborative, community, and public content. The system supports selective sharing, cross‑project item reuse, community publishing, and public interaction through an AI representative. The architecture enables creators to offload tasks, collaborate, publish work, and maintain a public presence, forming a unified environment where personal ideas and ambitions are transformed into actionable digital reality.
