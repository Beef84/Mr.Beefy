- The layer rewrites queries to enforce private, collaborative, community, or public scope.  
- The public agent is technically incapable of accessing private memory.

This embodiment strengthens privacy and security guarantees.

## **Embodiment 7: Style‑Adaptive Public Representation**

In this embodiment, the public agent dynamically adjusts its style based on:

- audience type  
- platform context  
- content category  
- user‑defined personas  

### Operation
- The system maintains multiple style profiles per tenant.  
- The public agent selects the appropriate style based on context.  
- The agent may switch styles mid‑conversation if needed.

This embodiment supports nuanced public representation.

## **Embodiment 8: Cross‑Project Memory Graph**

In this embodiment, the system models the tenant’s memory as a graph:

- nodes represent items  
- edges represent relationships (semantic, temporal, project‑based, collaborative)  

### Operation
- The private agent uses graph traversal to retrieve context.  
- The system supports multi‑hop reasoning across projects.  
- The graph evolves as the creator produces more content.

This embodiment enhances retrieval accuracy and creative continuity.
