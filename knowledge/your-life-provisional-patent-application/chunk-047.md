A practitioner can build the full system by following this operational flow:

1. Tenant signs up → control plane provisions tenant resources.  
2. Tenant uploads content → ingestion pipeline processes it.  
3. Knowledge base updates → embeddings, metadata, style profile.  
4. Private agent assists with creation and project development.  
5. Tenant shares items → collaboration layer enforces permissions.  
6. Tenant publishes items → community layer indexes them.  
7. Tenant configures public presence → public agent activates.  
8. External users interact → public agent responds using public memory.  
9. System logs interactions → private agent may summarize them.  

This flow demonstrates that the invention is fully implementable.

## Enablement conclusion

The invention is fully enabled because:

- all components are described in sufficient detail,
- all interactions are defined,
- all data structures are specified,
- multiple embodiments are provided,
- and a skilled engineer could build the system without undue experimentation.
