### 5. The public agent’s ability to act as a representative is technically novel  
The public agent:

- uses the creator’s style profile  
- accesses only public‑scoped memory  
- performs actions on behalf of the creator  
- integrates with external platforms  

This is not an obvious extension of chatbots or AI assistants, which do not operate as **identity‑consistent public representatives**.

## Summary of Novelty and Non‑Obviousness

The invention is novel because it introduces:

- a dual‑agent architecture  
- a multi‑layer visibility model  
- a unified ingestion pipeline  
- a personal world model  
- a public AI representative  

The invention is non‑obvious because:

- it unifies domains that have never been combined  
- it introduces visibility‑aware AI retrieval  
- it solves the problem of public vs. private representation  
- it creates a persistent, evolving digital identity  
- it enables creators to build a personal world powered by AI  

No existing system provides this combination of capabilities, nor does any prior art suggest the architectural mechanisms required to achieve them.
