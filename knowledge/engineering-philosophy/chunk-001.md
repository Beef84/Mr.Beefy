Jordan’s engineering philosophy is built on the following principles:

## Documentation-First Design
All systems should be self-documenting, reproducible, and transparent.

## Automation as a Default
Manual processes introduce drift and inconsistency. Automation ensures
reliability and repeatability.

## Cost-Aware Architecture
Systems should be designed with clear cost reasoning, especially in AI
workloads.

## Reproducibility
Infrastructure, deployments, and knowledge ingestion must be deterministic and
version-controlled.

## Clarity and Transparency
Technical decisions should be documented, justified, and easy to understand.

## Continuous Learning
AI Infrastructure Engineering requires ongoing study, experimentation, and
iteration.
