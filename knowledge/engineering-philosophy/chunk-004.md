# **9. Prioritize Clarity Over Cleverness**

Clever code breaks.  
Clear code lasts.

I choose:

- Readability over shortcuts  
- Explicit logic over magic  
- Predictability over novelty  
- Maintainability over cleverness  

A system should be understandable by anyone who inherits it — including future me.

# **10. Treat Documentation as Part of the Architecture**

Documentation isn’t an afterthought.  
It’s a structural component.

I document:

- Architecture  
- Design decisions  
- Workflows  
- Governance  
- Philosophy  

This ensures the system is not just functional — it’s teachable, explainable, and maintainable.

# **11. Build Systems That Respect Time and Life**

I built Mr. Beefy while:

- Working full‑time  
- Taking care of a farm  
- Being a husband  
- Being a dad  
- Being a grandpa  
- Exercising  
- Studying for AWS certifications  
- Hosting grandkids  
- And still showing up every day to build something meaningful  

My engineering philosophy reflects that reality:

- Build efficiently  
- Build intentionally  
- Build sustainably  
- Build systems that work *with* your life, not against it  

Engineering is not about grinding endlessly — it’s about designing well enough that you don’t have to.
