# **Long‑Term Goals (3–12 Months)**

### **1. Transition Into a Full‑Time AI Infrastructure Engineering Role**
- Use Mr. Beefy as a portfolio centerpiece  
- Demonstrate real‑world, production‑grade AI platform engineering  
- Show end‑to‑end ownership of architecture, IaC, CI/CD, and runtime  
- Position myself for senior‑level AI Infra roles  

### **2. Build Scalable, Production‑Grade AI Systems**
- Apply the patterns learned here to larger, more complex systems  
- Build reusable frameworks for:
  - Agent orchestration  
  - KB ingestion  
  - Retrieval pipelines  
  - Serverless AI backends
