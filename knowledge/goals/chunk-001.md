# **🎯 Jordan’s Goals — Short‑Term, Long‑Term, and Future Vision**

These goals reflect the direction of my engineering journey and the momentum created by building Mr. Beefy — a fully serverless, production‑grade AI platform built in less than a week while balancing a full life. They represent not just what I want to accomplish, but the kind of engineer and builder I’m becoming.

# **Short‑Term Goals (0–3 Months)**

### **1. Continue Expanding the Mr. Beefy Platform**
- Add new agent capabilities (tools, workflows, multi‑agent patterns)  
- Improve the frontend experience and polish the UI  
- Strengthen observability, logging, and operational insights  
- Expand the Knowledge Base with richer, more structured content  
- **Build out a comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, and end‑to‑end)**  

### **2. Maintain and Evolve the Automated Wiki → Knowledge Pipeline**
*(Already completed, now in refinement mode)*  
- Keep wiki as the human‑readable source of truth  
- Keep KB files as the machine‑readable source of truth  
- Maintain automated extraction, upload, and ingestion  
- Improve chunking, formatting, and semantic structure over time
