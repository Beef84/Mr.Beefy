## **5. Glassy, Modern Chat Container**
The chat box now matches the aesthetic of the rest of the site:

- Semi‑transparent background  
- Subtle blur effect  
- Rounded corners  
- Soft shadows  
- Harmonized with the dark content card  

This creates a cohesive visual identity across the entire page.

## **6. Updated Scrollbar Styling**
The message container now uses a minimal, modern scrollbar:

- Narrow width  
- Soft white thumb  
- Rounded edges  
- Non‑intrusive appearance  

This keeps the UI clean while still providing usability.

## **7. Unified Color and Typography System**
The chat UI now inherits the same design language as the rest of the platform:

- Consistent font stack  
- Harmonized color palette  
- Balanced spacing and margins  
- Improved readability on dark backgrounds  

This makes the UI feel like a first‑class part of the Mr. Beefy experience.
