## **2. Auto‑Scrolling Message Container**
A new scroll anchor ensures the chat always snaps to the latest message. This mirrors modern messaging apps and prevents the user from manually scrolling after every response.

- Smooth scroll behavior  
- No layout jumpiness  
- Works for both user and assistant messages

## **3. Improved Input Experience**
The message input area has been rebuilt for a more natural chat workflow:

- **Enter → send**
- **Shift+Enter → newline**
- **Auto‑resizing textarea** that grows with content
- **Consistent padding and spacing**
- **Predictable keyboard behavior**

This makes the UI feel responsive and intuitive during longer prompts.

## **4. Message Bubble Redesign**
User and assistant messages now have distinct, polished visual treatments:

### **User Messages**
- Right‑aligned  
- Soft blue bubble  
- High‑contrast text  
- Subtle shadow  

### **Assistant Messages**
- Left‑aligned  
- Warm white bubble  
- Clean typography  
- Balanced spacing  

Both bubble types support Markdown formatting and long‑form content.
