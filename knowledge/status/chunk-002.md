And with every correction, my understanding leveled up.  
The app got stronger.  
The architecture got cleaner.  
The whole system started to feel like something real.

# **💥 The Git History Disaster (A.K.A. “Jordan, Don’t Commit Terraform”)**

At one point, I forgot the cardinal rule:  
**Do not commit the Terraform folder.**

And of course, I did exactly that.

But instead of pretending it didn’t happen or nuking the repo from orbit, I rolled up my sleeves and fixed it.  
I rewrote my Git history, cleaned the repo, and restored order like it never happened.

That’s the thing about engineering — it’s not about never messing up.  
It’s about how fast you recover when you do.

# **⚙️ Day 3–4: The Backend Boss Fight**

Once the backend started taking shape, the universe decided to test me.

I hit:

- Bedrock alias mismatches  
- HTML `<UnknownOp>` errors  
- Region confusion  
- IAM permission hell  
- KB ingestion not triggering  
- Lambda calling the wrong alias  
- API Gateway silently failing routes  
- Terraform drift  
- Stale resources  
- Hidden AWS state  
- And logs that looked like they were written by a drunk XML parser  

Every time I solved one issue, another one popped up like a hydra head.
